## REMOTE STOCK QUOTE MICROSERVICE

This microservice allows a remote client to take a quote from various stock exchange companies around the world. The unique requiment is a valid stock symbol.  

### Infrastructure

This microservice is build using Nest.js, which is the most powerfull 
and well thought Node Framework for building modern web applications and microservices. 
Nest.js supports Typescript by default which together another modules of Node turns the 
final result application bullet proof. 

Backend Stack:

* Node.js
* TypeScript
* Nest.js 
* Docker

### Instalation

Installing the application is as straight as it can be:

1) Clone the remote repository in a directory under a desired spot in your localhost or remotehost.

&emsp;`$ cd microservices` <br>
&emsp;`$ git clone https://git.jobsity.com/jobsity/node-challenge.git` <br>

2) Install the packages and dependencies needed to run the application.

&emsp;`$ cd api-service` <br>
&emsp;`$ npm i` <br>


## Running

In order to run the application you need to follow some steps described below. You may run the application under Nest.js for development purposes or a Docker container can be upload.

Note: The transpiled code done by Typescript compiler is under the directory `dist` in the project root directory.

### Running via Nest.js (Development)

At the project root directory simply execute the following NPM command:

&emsp;`$ npm run start:dev` <br>

The application will be accessible for testing and operation at `http://localhost:3000`.

Note: Accessing the Microservice Entrypoint will load, by default, the user documentation and you can  follow the instructions to use the microservice.

### Running via Docker (Production)

Running the application under Docker is recomended.

Notes: 1) Docker Service must be running on localhost or remotehost. Details about installation and handling of Docker Service are beyond the escope of this documentation. 2) The application must run under a dedicated domain name with SSL enabled for security. For example: `https://api.remote-stock.io/v1`. In order the microservice to be accessible from a public domain name or in a public network as the Internet, the necessary configuration of DNS, Domain Registration, Proxy Server and possibly another resources may be needed. Those configurations are beyond the escope of this documentation.

Build the Docker Image of the application. Under the project's root directory
Faça o build da imagem Docker da aplicação. Enquanto estiver no diretório root do projeto, execute:

&emsp; `docker build -t conversor-sbf .`

Rode a imagem Docker, execute:

&emsp; `docker run -p 3000:3000 conversor-sbf`

Obs: A completa configuração do Container Docker com a imagem da aplicação, e os detalhes de operação e execução do Docker, fogem do escopo dessa documentação.
