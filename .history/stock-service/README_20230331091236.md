## REMOTE STOCK QUOTE MICROSERVICE

This microservice allows a remote client to take a quote from various stock exchange companies around the world. The unique requiment is a valid stock symbol.  

### Infrastructure

This microservice is build using Nest.js, which is the most powerfull 
and well thought Node Framework for building modern web applications and microservices. 
Nest.js supports Typescript by default which together another modules of Node turns the 
final result application bullet proof. 

Backend Stack:

* Node.js
* TypeScript
* Nest.js 
* Docker

### Instalation

Installing the application is as straight as it can be:

1) Clone the remote repository in a directory under a desired spot in your localhost or remotehost.

&emsp;`$ cd microservices` <br>
&emsp;`$ git clone https://git.jobsity.com/jobsity/node-challenge.git` <br>

2) Install the packages and dependencies needed to run the application.

&emsp;`$ cd api-service` <br>
&emsp;`$ npm i` <br>


## Running

In order to run the application you need to follow some steps described below. You may run the application under Nest.js for development purposes or a Docker container can be upload.

Note: The transpiled code done by Typescript compiler is under the directory `dist` in the project root directory.

### Install and run a local MongoDB Docker Instance

The application saves and reads data from a MongoDB database. To achive that you need to install and run a local MongoDB Docker Instance. Follow these commands:

&emsp;`$ sudo docker pull mongo` <br>
&emsp;`$ sudo docker run -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456 -p 27017:27017 -d mongo` <br>

There commands will download, install and run a local MongoDB Docker Instance. We are giving an user and password to login to mongo for security reasons. You can check if the instance was created properly by executing the command:

&emsp;`$ sudo docker ps` <br>

If everything goes well, a mongo instance should be listening on your `localhost:27017`. You shall be permitted to make a connection using the following connection string:

&emsp;`mongodb://admin:123456@localhost:27017/` <br>

Note: Use the file `mongo.config.ts` on the `src` directory on the project root to configure your application instance.

### Running via Nest.js (Development)

At the project root directory simply execute the following NPM command:

&emsp;`$ npm run start:dev` <br>

The application will be accessible for testing and operation at `http://localhost:3000`.

Note: 1) Accessing the Microservice Entrypoint will load, by default, the user documentation and you can  follow the instructions to use the microservice. 2) The fri

### Running via Docker (Production)

Running the application under Docker is recomended.

Notes: 1) Docker Service must be running on localhost or remotehost. Details about installation and handling of Docker Service are beyond the escope of this documentation. 2) The application must run under a dedicated domain name with SSL enabled for security. For example: `https://api.remote-stock.io/v1`. In order the microservice to be accessible from a public domain name or in a public network as the Internet, the necessary configuration of DNS, Domain Registration, Proxy Server and possibly another resources may be needed. Those configurations are beyond the escope of this documentation.

Build the Application Docker Image. Under the project's root directory, execute:

Note: We are using Linux/Unix. For another Operational Systems you should check the right way to run commands as administrator.

&emsp; `sudo docker build -t remote-stock .`

Run the Application Docker Image:

&emsp; `sudo docker run -p 3000:3000 remote-stock`

Note: The complete Application Docker Image Container configuration and the operational and running details are beyond the escope of this documentation.

## Testing

Testing the application to check for errors and misconfigurations is crucial.

Follow the steps below to run the tests:

A. Navigate to the `test` directory in the root of the project. <br>
B. Run the `./jest` command to run all Integration and Unit Tests.

Note: 1) You can run the tests individually by running `npx jest target-test-file.ts`. Where `target-test-file.ts` is any of the test files inside the `test` directory. 2) You can have a look at the `manitesto.txt` file inside `test` for a more detailed introduction about each test file. 3) We are using Linux/Unix. For another Operational Systems you should check the right way to run similar commands

## Logging

This microservice already has the versatile "Winston" Logging engine built in. The logging mechanism is configured to send any errors that occur in the application to `console.log` of Node. However, you can add other destinations to the error stream. For example you can send the error stream to Amazon Cloudwatch, to a MongoDB or Redis database, you can save everything to a file or simply send it to some monitored mailbox. Configuration of the means of transport and storage of errors generated by the application is beyond the scope of this document.

## Conclusion

This microservice uses the versioning method known as "Rolling Release". This means that the version on the `master` branch is always the most up-to-date version of the application. We understand that this is a simple and effective versioning method, which eliminates the complexity and the need to control and monitor strict versions of the software.
