{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Im1pZ3VlbGFuZ2Vsb21
  lbGxvQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsInN1YiI6IjY0Mjg2YmY0ZWE1OTAxNmQwNjg0MTJiYSIsImlhdCI6MTY4MDM3Mjc4OSwiZ
  XhwIjoxNjgwNDU5MTg5fQ.6tP4CUwuBqWPXSu1aLEoy7kCQnCnvEBEXRHDIXUWLNo"
}
    </pre>  

  </p>

  <p>
    <div><b>2.3 Use the JWT Token to access the routes</b></div><br>

    <pre>
GET /stocks/aapl.us HTTP/1.1
Host: https://api.stock-quote.io/v1
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Im1pZ3VlbGFuZ2Vsb21
lbGxvQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsInN1YiI6IjY0Mjg2YmY0ZWE1OTAxNmQwNjg0MTJiYSIsImlhdCI6MTY4MDM3Mjc4OSwiZXhwI
joxNjgwNDU5MTg5fQ.6tP4CUwuBqWPXSu1aLEoy7kCQnCnvEBEXRHDIXUWLNo
    </pre>    

    <div>Here as an example, a request to the route <code>/stocks/aapl.us</code> is being made. 
      You have to pay attention where you send the JWT Token on the request. The right place to 
      send is in the HEADER of the request, using the field <code>Authorization:</code> and on the 
      value side you write the JWT Token prefixing with <code>Bearer </code> keyword. This is a internet 
      Standard for sending JWT Tokens.
    </div><br>

    <div>
      If everything is okay with your token, you can use it for up to 24 hours. After that, you will 
      need to get a new token by following the steps above on item 2.2. Its a good idea to annotate 
      the token and the password you received by email, so you can use it again in the future. However 
      keep following to see how to reset your password.
    </div>

    on their side.

  <p>
    Server will respond with an Error Object Literal containing 
    the status and the message of error. Errors can be triggered 
    by the client itself, for example when sending mistyped endpoints 
    or the server itself can trigger a Error when a 
    task can not be completed for any reason. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>{ "statusCode": number, "message": string }</code><br>
    <div>
      The object literal returned will contain two properties: 
      "statusCode" with a number and "message" with the human readable text.

  <p>
