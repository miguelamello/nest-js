# Node.js Challenge

First of all, I'd like to grateful Jobsity for this pleasant exercice. I enjoyed to complete it. I'd appreciate to have more time to improve it as far as I could. However, I have to completed in my free time. 

1) About the services

On the project manifest was asked to build to services: 

- One for geting a remote stock quote from a resource on the web. 
- Another for letting users to get a stock quote from the company web services.

I decided to name those services like so, respectively:

- REMOTE STOCK QUOTE MICROSERVICE
- STOCK QUOTE MICROSERVICE

I think the order and name of the services are not a concern. What matters are what each service does and performs, right? If I'm wrong, I kindly ask for your forgiveness.

One good result from this modern approuch of small and decoupled applications is that one service can be replaced by another one and the other services not even will be disturbed by that change. Evidently if the new replacement service outputs the same data. I strong beliave in a infrastructure based on microservices. 

Sure, these services on this code challenge are for demonstration. However, in a real production environment I would accomplish a lot more tasks to deliver the best services I could, with security, efficiency, managebility and endurance. To list  a few:

* SSL protection for all the URLs;
* Authentication and encription for all routes;
* Load balancing and proxing for all services;
* Unified Authentication Central based on a fast "in memory" noSQL database;
*
